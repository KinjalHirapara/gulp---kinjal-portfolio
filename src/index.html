              In this role, I was responsible for developing interactive and
              responsive web applications using Angular, HTML, SCSS, and
              visualization libraries like ECharts and Kendo UI. I transformed
              static Adobe XD mockups into dynamic, user-friendly dashboards and
              reports, ensuring seamless performance across devices. By
              implementing Angular lazy loading and reusable components, I
              significantly improved load times and development efficiency.
              Collaborated with designers & backend teams to translate business
              requirements into functional features using Agile workflow.
              Additionally, mentoring junior developers and enforcing Git best

              Started my career as a Junior Front-End Developer, building
              interactive and responsive web applications using JavaScript.
              Focused on writing clean, maintainable code while improving API
              integration and data handling for smoother user interactions.
              Gained experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, and
              optimizing front-end performance to enhance page speed and
              responsiveness. Worked closely with senior developers and UX
              teams, translating wireframes into pixel-perfect,
              cross-browser-compatible applications while debugging and
              improving front-end workflows.

              As I progressed in my role as a Front-End Developer, I gained
              hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web
              applications using Angular. I focused on developing reusable
              Angular components, optimizing data binding, and improving state
              management for better application performance. I worked on admin
              panels, theme-based applications, dashboards, and Custom CMS
              application, focusing on responsive design and functionality. I
              learned and applied Git version control, contributing to branch
              management and code synchronization within a collaborative
              development environment. I utilized Trello and TMetric for task
              updates, tagging, time tracking, and Agile sprint progress
              monitoring, improving team communication and workflow efficiency.

With this tool, the client can now easily track the progress of all their projects and the number of hours spent by each team member associated with the projects. One of its unique features is the two-way authentication where the user receives an SMS containing a verification code. This provides additional security to the client's critical data."
